        <P class="the-arrival">once It was 1 week before I got to know I was going saudia Arabia.<br> My parents asked me if I wanted to go my heart was saying yes but my mind was saying no<br>. I go to my parent’s ill think about it that night I was thinking I don’t want 2 go yet I am not ready.<br> Had a dream that night I was in saudia Arabia, in front of the khaba (god’s house), I was praying in front of it I was so happy to be there. I was with my cousin asma go Aqeel its so good to be here isn’t it he was saying yeah mash Allah its wonderful then suddenly I hear a big “bang” noise going “wake up wake up” it was my mum screaming from down stairs<br>. I got up, I was thinking oh my god my dream was so lovely I ran down stairs </p> <p class="thinking">I told my mum straight away I wanted to go saudia arabia she was so happy she gave me a hug and goes I am so glad you are going she goes your going to love it when your there<br>. I was really excited to go, because my cousin Aqeel and Harun where going to go aswell so it was good cause I would have had company<br>. We phoned my uncle that I was going he booked the tickets.</p>

Four days later that night every one was at my house because we had a family reunion, we were so excited to go we was chatting about how it was going to be? What the people are going to be like? How the atmosphere is going to be like? we couldn’t get over it we was so excited, also we found out that we was going to stop at Dubai that got us even more excited cause we have never seen Dubai before. It was about 11.00 o’clock every one start going home all ma family gave me £20 pound each cause they was so happy to see me going to my gods house every one went home. I was really excited I went upstairs and went to sleep I first put my alarm for 4 0 clock in the morning, our flight was for 8 o clock I went to sleep I had a lovely dream I was just half way threw my dream and my alarm goes off it was 4 o clock I was so excited every one came to my house, then we went to my nans house to say goodbye to everyone then we was set off to our journey to the airport.
